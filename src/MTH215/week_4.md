### Ricatti Differential Equations:
Ricatti Equations come in the form of
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) = R(x)y^2 + Q(x)
$$
Because you are still learning the fundementals, you will be given a hint to solve Ricatti, a particular solution. Using it, you will be able to convert the Ricatti D.E to a Linear D.E.
